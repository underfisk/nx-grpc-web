## Description

This project contains a codegen for gRPC as an Nx library which helps developers to quickly generate typescript service definitions based on the protobufs that are co-located

## Proto/GRPC codegen

Running `pnpm nx codegen grpc` will generate your api at `libs/grpc`. Protobufs files are collocated in the same folder under `protobufs`

**Note**: If you get "permission denied" please make sure `proto_codegen.sh` is an executable, you can do that by running

```sh
chmod +x ./tools/proto_codegen.sh
```
